My name is Min Lu. I am currently a Masters student studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Previously I was a Bachelors student studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics at Purdue University. Currently, I am interested in learning more about AI alignment and Machine Learning Security. Specifically, I am doing research on machine unlearning, and am attempting to develop a more mathematically rigorous verification framework for machine unlearning. I can be contacted using the following channels.
